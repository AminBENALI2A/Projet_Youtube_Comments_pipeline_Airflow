StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2023-07-25T21:06:52Z,hello I like your videos keep it up One note though regarding the naming of your first data frame datamatrix which is confusing because later on you actually call the dataframe when you are doing the ggplot2 part and its a easy to get confused Just an FYI cheers Great video
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2023-07-05T20:55:21Z,I was really struggling to get a grip on using PCA in R  you explained prcomp so well Thank you
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2023-02-20T09:48:28Z,Josh whenever I have a question about data science your channel is the goto Thank you for the clear teaching
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2023-01-17T03:41:03Z,Next time use grades example or something more simple not genes
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-05-14T07:38:16Z,I am having trouble converting my xlsx samples as columns and variables as rows to a matrix as in the code example so how do I read the data in my case Note my data has NA39s which further complicates my situation
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-05-11T13:56:27Z,Perfect Thank you
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-04-25T19:31:40Z,The quotdata framequot sections keeps throwing the error  quotarguments imply differing number of rowsquot and I39m using the code from this example any ideas how to fix it
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-03-24T10:59:43Z,Its amazing that you can teach stuff in 10 minutes with Hooray and BAM that I cannot learn with weeks of studying books
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-03-16T23:15:34Z,No matter how many times I say thank you  can not express my thankness to you
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-03-10T20:20:39Z,This was the first time that I saw your videos and it39s absolutely great Thank you As a beginner I am struggling with the R software package Do you have some videos on basic R so that I can successfully deal with my statistics
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-03-10T13:54:13Z,If I normalize my data first using a method like median of ratios or quantile normalization do I still need to use scale  TRUE in the prcomp call Btw thank you for making these amazing videos They really help me understand difficult statistics topics
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-02-16T13:26:11Z,I wish we could like each of your videos more than once

StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2022-01-18T22:14:08Z,Oh You39re great
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-12-15T17:32:30Z,Do I use normalized count data or raw count data
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-11-13T09:04:26Z,How did equivalent poison initialization  lead to such clean separation of otherwise meaningless variables variables different in name only
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-11-01T10:53:28Z,I have dataset with 208 rows and 2000 columns when I use prcomp no matter I use t or not the out put is 208 PCA why is that happen
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-10-20T16:15:39Z,I wonder why we never used vegan to look at eigenvalues
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-10-18T05:04:46Z,Hello I would like to ask if you standardize your data before doing the PCA It seems that I did not see it but I could also be wrong
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-09-16T19:31:34Z,Thank you is the least thing to say here So it39s whatever words beyond thank you
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-08-14T13:42:42Z,Your channel saved my grades during my entire stats undergrad
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-07-29T23:16:17Z,I was wondering how you were able to use quotSamplequot in your code for the ggplot It is coming up as an error for me The only sample code they list is sample which is a different function
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-07-13T20:38:47Z,This is awesome as always Can we apply PCA on categorical data
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-06-10T22:02:19Z,StatQuest with Josh Starmer   Hi Josh just wanted to confirm is it because of the fact that the number of samples are lower than the number of featuresvariables therefore there is an upper bound for how many PCs we can expect in this example which is 10
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-05-02T21:06:50Z,any advice on RDA when to use RDA and vegan package usage
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-05-02T09:39:48Z,Could you do the same video but using Python or MATLAB Please
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-04-29T14:27:59Z,Thank you so much
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-04-18T16:34:43Z,Thanks a lot very clear and helpful video
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-04-14T05:44:05Z,You sir deserve a medal Thank you so much
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-04-06T23:57:36Z,Thank you Josh Starmer for explaining PCA in detail Can you please explain how to find weights of a variable by PCA for making a composite index Is it rotation values that are for PC1 PC2 etc For example if I have Iw1Xw2Yw3Z then how to find w1 w2 w3 by PCA
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-04-03T17:00:01Z,i didn39t understand this after watching pca step by step theoretical video too And I feel that due to your confusing dataset I heard pca is used to reduce the number of dimensions or mostly number of features in a dataset but here are genes the feautre  i don39t feel so as there are 100 Or those wi ki are features doesn39t seem so as they are not getting reduced
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-03-31T18:11:03Z,In the PCA Step by Step video PC1 and PC2 correspond to Genes 1 and Genes 2 But here the PCs stand for the samples Why is the a difference With 100 genes i expected 100 PCs and then the PC with the highest variation percent was the gene responsible for the most variation between samples
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-03-24T12:41:15Z,Thank you sir you are saving my lazyass once again
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-03-23T20:40:31Z,It blows my mind how much people like you know about several topics Statistics probability coding machine learningbiology and I39m sure more You39re nuts And I meant that as a compliment
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-03-18T03:11:02Z,autoplot is another handy tools to plot pca
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-03-04T17:39:03Z,Thanks so much this was very useful
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-02-15T16:55:58Z,Why didn39t we center the data like before
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-02-06T10:34:20Z,is the rotation same as the loading vectors
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-01-14T19:47:54Z,This is great except that I39m not sure that the quotrotationquot matrix contains the loadings According to the prcomp documentation the rotation matrix contains the eigenvectors which they also call the quotloadingsquot which is not correct
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2021-01-06T09:34:10Z,Joining the list of many others that have thanked you for the awesome explanation
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-12-14T22:24:08Z,tip if you want a nice looking scree plot in R then just do installpackagesquotdevtoolsquot and then installpackagesquotfactoextraquot EDIT use fviz_eigdf to make the plot itself
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-12-04T02:44:13Z,Hi So after performing PCA which variables should I include the model The genes with positive loading score Do the genes that have positive loading score  are correlated with first principal componentVariables that are correlated with PC1 ie Dim1  are the most important in explaining the variability in the data set So the genes which have positive loading score should we keep them for the model
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-11-26T07:31:55Z,I beg beg beg you to make a video about exploratory factor analysis my professor really sucks at it and you made it so perfectly clear
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-11-25T08:54:22Z,what does 39size139 do in rpois function
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-10-21T05:24:50Z,Where do I find this R code
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-10-18T08:37:07Z,now I am good to gothanks big
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-10-01T08:07:42Z,Thank you so much for the tutorial I have a question is it better to do PCA analysis only for genes that have a significant differential expression
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-09-24T14:43:20Z,Why can39t all teachers teach like you
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-08-22T12:20:09Z,This the 200 comment i am feeling lucky sir I like your Hello in the start
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-07-28T08:29:11Z,First Thank you for the video It is a life saver I am a very practical person and until I do not see the values I have problems getting the abstract idea I have a question which version of R did you use It gave me an error as I tried to use in my R 36 the function sort with the parameter decreasingTRUE Thanks and have a great day
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-07-22T17:27:57Z,This is an outstanding explanation I tried the PCA and in my case PC2 is greater than PC1 The values are in negative axis What does it mean Can you help me
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-07-20T19:55:02Z,Why do we set scale  T I39m comparing some RNAseq data that replicates results from a paper when I set it to F but doesn39t in another case Is my setting scale  F and recapitulating their results just a coincidence They used many more steps to determine DEGs whereas I just picked the top 20 loading scores by absolute value
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-07-09T05:39:31Z,Thanks Josh amazing video One question My PC1 and PC2 account for only 40 variation and I have to cluster my observations Thus I need to use 7 PCs that account for 75 variation for a fair clustering How should I go about that and more so how should I show it graphically in a 2D space
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-07-01T21:53:28Z,Thank you so much
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-06-29T14:37:51Z,Thank you Josh I managed to make PCA and got an impression of my RNAseq data clustering However since I got an error  39cannot rescale a constantzero column to unit variance39 while trying to scale data I left it out What exactly does this problem mean and how could I fix it no proper explanations can be found in google thanks
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-06-14T10:14:03Z,If our variables are in different scales eg Temperature Body mass should we logtransform our data right
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-06-01T12:35:20Z,I love this thank you it makes so much sense
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-05-31T14:17:34Z,If we had a data table with also numeric and factor variables like age sexcancer treatment what we do Standar PCA is only for numeric if im rightI found a PCAmix function in R Is that all i need
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-05-30T15:27:43Z,Why does everyone always just show graphs on this topic never how to use that information to create a modeling input with less dimensions In my data I know from the graphs 50 out of 800 variables describe 95 of the variance but how do I select just those 50 out of pca to form a new less dimensions model training  test set
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-05-13T21:53:12Z,sooooo nicethanks
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-05-05T16:50:01Z,Thanks for the tutorial but I39m completely new in R  can you tel me how to read the a custom data from a CSV file for pca And export the load score in another CSV txt file
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-05-05T10:43:40Z,Thank you so much You saved me a lot of time
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-04-27T17:45:16Z,I got a question after transposing the data it will be 10100 dimension But why are we getting 10 PCs Is it not supposed to be 100PCs Which is the same amount as the number of columns  ie the 100 genes that are transposed  Thanks
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-04-25T12:40:19Z,very interesting Thanks How to draw the 95 CI in the plot
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-04-23T13:35:25Z,Hi great video The link to the R code isn39t working is there any other way I could access it thanks
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-04-23T07:26:36Z,This was amazing I was afraid of the name quotPCAquot in R but you mad it so easy
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-04-16T21:36:05Z,Thank you very much for this Do you have any specific recommendations for online courses to learn R in a biological context for someone coming from the bench side of research looking to perform more detailed RNAseq data analysis from publicly available databases
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-04-08T11:35:25Z,Thanks for your video But as a beginner it seems to me I am finding something in BlackBox Please first show the data in any format like excel I am actually can not understand I am sorry
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-03-19T21:21:22Z,Not all heroes wear capes
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-03-07T21:25:56Z,I am a bit confused sdev is used to calculate percentage of variance explained by PC If the data points are centered based on gene1 gene2 values does it guarantee the projected points on PC1 and PC2 axises are also centered from origin I am asking this because in the video PCA in R sdev is used to calculate percentage of variance explained by PC so I guess mean must be 0 so that SSdistancensdev2 Am I right
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-02-28T11:08:31Z,PCA is generally done on numerical variables in the data you have genes column which character how do you manage this in prcomp function i was trying a similar experiment where I have MSMS data 100 proteins and 20 samples in one column i have protein names when i run prcomp function it is displaying  Error in colMeansx narm  TRUE  39x39 must be numeric in the final step how did u get the top 10 gene names if I omit that in the loading score column I am getting null sir please explain this
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2020-02-21T08:41:06Z,Best stats lecture ever Thank you This needs more views

StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2019-02-11T19:48:13Z,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THIS IS SO USEFULsorry
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2019-01-28T15:58:35Z,Didn39t understand
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2019-01-08T23:31:41Z,I recall in the introductory vid to PCA you explained how to calculate loading score for each gene when there are only 2 variables I am curious how do you calculate them in this case with multiple variables
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-12-16T10:55:45Z,very nice explanation about PCA  can you explain about variance portioning analysis VPA in R
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-12-14T18:17:46Z,Thanks for your efforts in explainingCould you please suggest some data sources for practicing
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-11-28T04:26:16Z,This is amazing
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-11-24T16:16:22Z,manyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy thanks you helped me very much great and complete explanation
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-11-21T06:23:58Z,Correct me pls I think there should be 100 PCs for each gene to discriminate the 10 samples while you said only 10 PCs if this is due to transposition needed by prcomp then should there be 100 dots in the graph Now it looks like 10PCs for 10 samples where does the 100 genes go
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-11-11T14:38:50Z,Well explained thanks  I used PCA trying out different packages would be nice to have some information on those mentioned as well some of them provide nice functions for visualisation When I dotry PCA I find it most challenging to prepare the dataset to be suitable for PCA but I guess that is a different topic of how to standardize variables and what to do with categorical variables etc
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-07-17T21:40:10Z,Hello could you or someone else explain the concept of PCA in whole genome analysis
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-07-04T05:28:56Z,hello Josh can you please explain in Matlab for the same example  Love the way you explain the codes line by line thank you so much
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-06-05T12:34:14Z,Hi Joshua to clarify in prcomp the scale  T means each value in the original dataset not the transposed one would minus the rowMean and then divided by standard deviation of the row
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-05-10T17:31:17Z,MEGAAA BAMMMM
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2018-04-01T16:52:43Z,Awesome Watched 10039s of tutorials and all were confusing It39s the best one and as said clearly explained Thanks Joshua

StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2017-11-27T23:28:54Z,Thanks Josh I hope you get the chance to explain MCA in a similar fashion please
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StatQuest: PCA in R,2017-11-27T16:53:28Z,Quick question about PCA Mr Joshua why do need to mean center the data before doing it I get why we need to normalise sometimes but I cannot understand the need to mean center the data Looking around online there are explanations but nothing that makes sense to me

StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2024-03-18T16:17:55Z,B R
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2024-02-13T03:29:58Z,I sometimes come just for the intros Amazing work
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-12-26T10:26:32Z,you explain really well better than the course I am following thanks
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-10-08T10:44:33Z,excellent explanation for complexity of model
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-09-09T16:54:49Z,So will Lasso remove the highly correlated ones in elastic net regression or will the combined effect of both lasso and ridge will just shrink the highly correlated features  I am still unclear on that  Who wins in terms of handling the correlated features  Lsso or Ridge
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-07-23T00:40:23Z,nice explanation
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-07-05T22:59:16Z,I like it a lot when he said the super fancy thing is actually xxx
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-07-04T21:02:21Z,Thank you so much Josh  I was struggling with Lasso Ridge and ElasticNet Regression for my graduate class  Your 3 videos cleared up all the confusion  Thank you SO much for all that you do to make these topics accessible for all
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-02-22T19:08:33Z,Yeeha
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-01-06T23:47:55Z,I have now finished the 3 parts ouf Thank you a thousand times for the awesome content you provide
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2023-01-01T06:56:46Z,This clears things up a lot 4 years on still the best explanation online Yeeha
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-10-16T16:05:10Z,brilliant  but have a doubt in mind that how are we sure that elastic net regression would not cause high variance since its summing both ridge and lasso and due to this  it will guide the model to change through a higher range
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-09-29T15:25:17Z,Ihaaa All tutorials are brilliant A huge thank you
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-09-06T04:58:09Z,Thanks Josh its 2022 and your videos saved me well
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-08-19T14:20:56Z,can you please justify that why you used mountain for ridge and loop for lasso very curious to know please tell
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-07-27T09:04:06Z,Another great video Keep it up Always big fan
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-07-20T14:33:19Z,man i love your way of teaching
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-07-10T14:23:10Z,OMG I39m so happy I found your channel
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-05-16T15:13:58Z,Man that intro is the best it forces me to listen to the rest of the lecture Thanks
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-05-05T13:28:11Z,Thanks for the video Josh Your explaination makes sense but i can39t wrap my head to think of a reason why would this work still If we know some variables that are less important eg Age in your previous example don39t we still have those variables that in the loss function Is it just that their impact will be sitting in between none and when using L2
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-03-07T11:34:01Z,Thanks for the clearly explanation so since elastic regression is the best should we just use elasitc regression every time instead of using lasso or ridge
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2022-02-11T06:27:24Z,Hi doesn39t the separate lambda values for each of the penalties make this a LAVA regression rather than an elastic net regression Just curious
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-12-19T00:27:29Z,Yeeha
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-11-24T00:11:29Z,Thank you for your wonderful videos It really helped me to understand ridgelassoelastic net I still have one question though it seems like elastic net regression can delete some variables even though both lambda 1 and 2 are not 0 I found it from other papers but I am not sure how that is possible if lambda 2 is not 0 do you have any idea for this Thanks again
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-11-14T14:52:02Z,you save my life
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-10-19T19:01:08Z,You are the best I indeed learned a lot from you Thanks
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-10-11T11:02:27Z,Dear Josh thank you so much for making life easier for us if you believe in heaven you will be one the firsts in lol A question how does the Lasso eliminate one of the correlated variables lets say i have two identical variables v1 and v2 with 100 correlation how does the lasso work on them thank you in advance
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-10-06T05:56:23Z,Thanks a lot for your amazing videos I just wondering when I use Elastic Net the coefficient of useless variable seems will not go to zero because of the part of the Ridge Regression in the equation So why not just use Losso Regression first to eliminate the useless variable and then use the Ridge Regression to regularize
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-10-04T21:25:35Z,Why do we not use parentheses after each lambda I got confused as we did in the two earlier videos on regularization Thanks for helping out
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-09-13T10:43:35Z,Thank you so much Once again your videos are of invaluable help to my PhD dissertation  And the quotBrrrquot made me laugh out loud D
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-09-08T21:50:31Z,Great video thank you I39m just a bit unsure about the scaling of features Say if we scale a feature what would change for lasso and ridge
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-08-23T10:21:47Z,Thanks I ended up googling that airspeed of a swallow thing and watching a Monty Python scene instead of learning how to do elastic net lol
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-06-15T12:45:35Z,In the intro song I thought you would say quotsimpler than you might expect it to bequot cause that rhymes Anyways love your videos Thanks for doing such great work
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-06-05T07:32:30Z,Your explanations are on point and easy to understand Can be used as quick reference
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-05-17T11:28:05Z,Thnx sir
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-04-29T09:53:45Z,Awesome explanation but i think you forgot the bracket in the equation for Lasso and Ridge Reg equation  The Lambda is supposed to multiply with the whole sum of squared slopes or absolute slopes
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-04-18T05:30:42Z,The best explanations I could find online for Stats Thank you Josh
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-03-15T14:39:15Z,Hey Josh Thank you for this watched your 4 regularization videos today and am happy And a suggestion for a related followup video  collinearity amp multicollinearity
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-03-01T04:02:56Z,Would you say elastic net is better than the ridge or lasso regression
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-03-01T02:55:16Z,Thank you Josh for this excellent video on ElasticNet Regression It was a great finish to this 3part series on Regularization
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-02-19T05:51:48Z,Thanks so much for this video I have a quick question if I may Didn39t u mention in the last video that the lamda for ridge can be close to 0 but never equals 0  I was confused in the part where you say lamda 2 in the elasticnet regression can be 0 which makes it a lasso regression  Thank you in advance for your explanation
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-02-09T03:49:59Z,Sir I really liked your style thank you for such entertainment and informative lecture
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2021-02-02T05:24:05Z,It doesn39t gets more easier than this lt3
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-12-21T07:21:06Z,brr
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-12-18T12:58:56Z,Thank you your video is very useful
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-12-17T19:11:03Z,what exactly do you mean by the parameter in this example
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-12-14T09:49:59Z,So Lasso Regression can take care of multi collinearity issues
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-12-13T05:27:49Z,The intro song with 20 speed is nice alternative to the original version D
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-12-10T15:04:48Z,Thanks But what if we want to estimate a variable from only one variable  does using elastic net regression improve the results I already used Ols  r_aquared 065 with rms004 How to improve the model
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-11-05T04:28:54Z,quick question for the ElasticNet is this one strictly convex
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-10-27T15:38:23Z,Hi Josh your lessons are so nice that I decided to support you I bought your digita album quotMade from TVquot You rock
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-10-15T03:22:00Z,You explain the concepts so well Thanks a lot for these videos
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-10-08T07:31:40Z,Statquest staaaaat quest whaaat are we learning today
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-09-28T20:17:26Z,At first I came here for the stats revision Lately I39ve been finding myself visiting to remind myself of the tunes instead
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-08-25T18:47:16Z,Amazing Better than God Andrew Ng
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-08-09T03:57:39Z,African or European  Thats good
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-07-26T17:02:17Z,Sir your videos are amazing I have a question though In case of deep neural networks why make the model complex and then add regularization or dropout  isn39t a better idea not to create the problem at the first place that is not make the model complex And if the the model is overfitting shouldn39t trying to reduce the complexity of the model be the solution
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-07-16T16:12:43Z,hi josh am still unable to understand the advantage of elastic net regressioni can easily understand how ridge regression is advantageous compared to lassoie instead of completely eliminating correlated features it shrinks the parameters associated with those featuresnow plz tell how elasticnet is advantageous compared to using ridge regression alone
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-06-25T15:49:06Z,I am in love with your videos Josh BAM I just wanted to ask when we have so many features and multicollinear variables real case datasets is applying Elastic Net Regression always better than Ridge and Lasso I mean we cannot actually check that as there are so many variables  Your Deep Learning Example so can we say that Elastic Net is best of both worlds We can apply it in most of the scenarios where making a hypothesis about the features not very simple
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-06-18T16:42:15Z,Machine learning is everywhere
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-06-09T18:29:41Z,I love your channel
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-06-02T14:45:11Z,Hi Josh Thank you for another awesome video I have one qn how to decide which parameters to group for lasso and ridge penalty for Elastic net regression are they selected randomly thanks in advance
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-06-01T20:38:02Z,Hi I don39t fully understand what quotregularizationquot means here
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-05-28T06:21:09Z,POISSON REGRESSION PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION PLEASEEE DR JOSHHH  WE LOVE YOU lt3 FROM TORONTO
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-05-11T19:43:02Z,Lasso does the job of shrinking the coefficients AND removing the useless parameters right
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-05-06T00:41:43Z,Why would elastic net remove the parameters of correlated variables altogether or keep them and shrink them I thought its a little bit of both
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-05-02T22:06:42Z,Wow Ur channel is a boon to beginners like me in the world of Data ScienceThanks a lot
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-04-12T13:18:14Z,When I first watched one of your videos I was struck by how entertaining it was But the more videos I watch the more I notice how well I39m understanding the explanations in your videosThanks a lot for your amazing efforts
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-04-06T18:40:34Z,I love your channel man its the major reason I39ll be majoring in Data science in college
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-03-24T20:04:56Z,Hey Josh thanks for the crisp explanation Today after long procrastination I managed to watch all three of the videos  L1 L2 and Elastic Net
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-03-21T14:12:47Z,BAM
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-03-03T10:29:39Z,Hi not sure how ElasticNet will get the best of both worlds The Lasso part may remove some variables but the Ridge part will keep them there so the model while maybe better will be as complex as the Ridge model as it has the same number of variables so we do not get the quotsimplificationquot benefit
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2020-01-13T08:14:29Z,Are regularization required for treebased models with smaller number of data
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-12-25T07:01:47Z,Lasso Yeeha   Ridge Brrr  Elastic Net
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-12-09T11:50:58Z,Should I say Elastic Net is always better but it comes with high computation price
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-10-14T00:40:06Z,I can39t say which is better your albums or this amazing series
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-09-19T14:43:06Z,Only reason I subscribed you is because of your singing before every videos No doubt you explain  very well
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-09-15T18:30:58Z,The number of views seems to fall exponentially from the part 1 to 3 Funny
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-09-05T05:43:02Z,Question why are lambdas a scalar instead of a vector because if lambda is 0 for example we39d be applying no penalty for none of the variables how would we be able to penalize some variables vs others
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-08-26T12:43:40Z,Thank you so much Would love to give you a kiss for your great work but perhaps you prefer me buying a copy of your original song
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-08-05T08:14:18Z,Your presentations are good  short clear and well explained However the quotlambdaquot parameters have to be arbitrarily chosen so the Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression methods lose objectivity  the result depends on the observer I wonder where those methods are used In my opinion the classic Least Means Squares LMS or LMS with statistical weights in different variations are still the best methodstechniques for reduction of experimental data and modeling
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-07-26T15:47:23Z,What does it mean lasso regression will pick up just one correlated terms and eliminate the others
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-07-13T21:12:14Z,Hi everyone Could I consider the lambda as a hyperparameter in Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-06-12T05:08:48Z,Thank you very much Josh for explaining regularization so clearly  The visuals that you use in your videos makes the learning easy
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-06-10T01:23:15Z,Love your clearly explained videos And your songs are so sweet like Phoebe Buffays
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-06-09T21:11:39Z,Thank you for the amazing videos Your ability to explain the concepts simply is incomparable
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-05-14T05:30:00Z,I want to know something Minimum sample size for ridge and lasso is I have checked tons of papers where some journals use at least 4 and others use 30 and others requires to estimate like Greenes for about 250 observatoins Would this change with ridge and lasso regressions
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-04-15T19:04:37Z,whoa lt3 you39re amazing i like your style i like your opening songs lol that is a beautiful way to teach students
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-04-13T01:26:56Z,Thank you for the tutorial One thing I don39t get is why Elastic Net can remove some variables It has the component of Ridge regression so a variable won39t be removed all together How come
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-04-06T13:55:49Z,Wonderful brilliant awesome What a relief Finally I understand some important concepts of the statistics Thank you very much Josh

StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-02-19T19:58:23Z,Hi Josh Just revisited this video and very clearly explained But what are the disadvantages of elastic net Is this model more computational expensive
StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Regularization Part 3: Elastic Net Regression,2019-02-03T12:50:16Z,Hi Josh  i have doubt  we usually remove the correlated variables while performing data cleaning  so why are we considering these correlated variables
